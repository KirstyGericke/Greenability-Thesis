The refactoring effort, in my opinion, directly depends on the required testing effort.
The testing effort depends on how much of the codebase has been impacted.
The ""how much"" is determined by the volume of the system and the dependency structure (how coupled the things are). 

Please note that many of these refactoring can be done automated nowadays, meaning that there is almost no manual effort. However, the testing is still the actual effort."

I mostly based by answers on 1 or 2 characteristics per model; e.g. with fewer LOC I assume there are less possible candidates for the given refactoring type, so less effort."
